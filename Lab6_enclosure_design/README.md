Welcome to the enclosure design lab.  You'll make a simple enclosure for your PCB, similar to the example.

To transfer data from the PCB program into Fusion we'll use a STEP file which is a common format for 3D interchange that will maintain geometry and dimensions and works for multi-part assemblies.  For the PCB you can export a STEP file from KiCAD (recommended to try this yourself) or just use the STEP file in the repository. 

Build an enclosure similar to the example we will show during the lecture.  It must :

    Be your own design !
    Support the PCB with features to fasten in place
    Have flexure or other secondary part that allows the button to be pressed
    Have a window or other feature that allows you to see the LED
    Have a unique identifying feature (your name, or a logo embossed into the device)


For reference you can look at the example Fusion file in this repo.  I recommend using the timeline feature of Fusion to roll back and look at individual steps.  There are many ways to build a model, so its totally OK if you approach it differently.

When you're finished, upload to canvas : 

Your Fusion file (F3D)

A STEP export file of your parts

Section views as described in the rubric (screenshot is OK)

    main cross-section view showing joints between parts
    
    section or detail view to show your LED viewing feature
    
    3D AND section views showing the button feature
    
    3D views of complete device

For details of what must be uploaded to canvas, please consult the assignment rubric (which will always take precedence)
